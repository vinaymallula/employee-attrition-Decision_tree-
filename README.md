# Employee Attrition Prediction ðŸš€

Employee attrition (or churn) is a critical problem faced by many organizations. Losing skilled employees not only impacts productivity but also increases hiring and training costs.

In this project, I built a Machine Learning pipeline to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company, based on historical HR data.
The project also analyzes feature importance to identify key factors that drive attrition.
